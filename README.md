<h1> Latest Work </h1>

My latest Data Warehouse (see <a href = "https://github.com/RemoteDataEngineer/FlDogs/blob/main/template.json"> ARM template </a> in the <a href = "https://github.com/RemoteDataEngineer/FlDogs"> Fl Dogs repository </a>) is inspired by our current shelter dog crisis in Florida. The <a href = "https://github.com/RemoteDataEngineer/FlDogs/blob/main/PetfinderApi%20FlDogs%20Production%2020230731.pbix"> Power Bi </a> uses Direct Query data from a Delta Lake that is populated <a href = "https://www.petfinder.com/developers/v2/docs/"> Petfinder API </a> data, ingested with an <a href = "https://github.com/RemoteDataEngineer/FlDogs/blob/main/Template%20for%20Standard%20Version%20of%20SummerInterview2023%20Logic%20App.zip" > Azure Logic App </a>, and transformed and loaded through <a href = "https://github.com/RemoteDataEngineer/FlDogs/tree/main/Databricks%20Notebooks"> Azure Databricks Notebooks </a>, and an <a href = "https://github.com/RemoteDataEngineer/FlDogs/blob/main/Template%20for%20ADF%20For%20Each%20Databricks%20Config%20Row.zip"> Azure Data Factory </a>. 

Within the Power Bi, end users can search a Delta Lake refreshed weekly with a database of thousands of dogs available for adoption in Florida.

<b> With significant experience as a Senior Analyst, Data Quality Engineer, Data Architect and Data Engineer, I believe my skillset is an excellent match for your organization. </b>

<h1>Data Engineering</h1>

In my previous <b> Senior Data Engineer </b> roles, I worked extensively with Microsoft tools such as <b>Azure Data Factory</b>, <b>Azure SQL </b>, <b>Azure Databricks</b>, <b>Azure Synapse Analytics</b> and <b>Azure DevOps</b>. I was responsible for orchestrating bulk copy pipelines within Azure Data Factory, championing standard operating procedures for moving artifacts through <b>CI/CD pipelines</b>, and designing, validating and scripting stored procedures that loaded Fact and Dim tables into Azure SQL in under 5 minutes, 100% validated for data accuracy and completeness, with documentation. Furthermore, I built reliable roadmaps in Azure DevOps for addressing vague technical problems, creating <b>Data Models</b> and <b>Analytical Reports</b> with complex Dax Tables, Measures, and Columns for enterprise-wide route reporting utilizing <b>Power BI</b>.

<h1>Data Quality and Data Governance</h1>
In my <b> Data Quality Engineer </b>  and <b> Data Governance </b> roles, I set up a data estate for hardware engineering information systems in <b>Microsoft Purview</b>, and I built a proof of concept by populating databases in Azure SQL and Azure Synapse Analytics. Additionally, I created <b>Python</b> scripts for <b>Exploratory Data Analysis</b> of <b>Machine Learning</b> datasets, worked with SMEs to scan databases, set up schedules in Purview, and deleted items in Purview using <b>REST APIs</b>. Updating tasks for Sprint Planning and maintaining code in repos were also a part of my responsibilities as a data quality engineer at Microsoft.

<h1>Hospital Work</h1>
In my hospital roles, I have earned certifications in <b></b>Cerner and <b>Epic Clarity</b>, re-written Transact SQL reports into <b> Spark SQL with Databricks </b>, created dependable <b> Tabular Data Models</b> from Clarity data to simplify Surgical Reporting, in addition to troubleshooting optimized canned Epic Crystal and Webi reports for faster run times.

<h1> Data Analysis </h1>
In addition to all Data Warehouses, Data Marts and Tabular Cubes being 100% validated and documented before deployment, I also have a wide variety of  Data Analysis experience in industries as varied as Hospital Analytics, Clinical Trials, External Audit, Waste Management and Hardware Engineering. The <a href = "https://github.com/RemoteDataEngineer/SalesDemo/blob/main/Heichman%20Sales%20Demo.pbix"> SalesDemo Power Bi </a> showcases the type of work I produce in cooperation with Revenue Cycle, Operations or Compliance to quantify an organizaton's success. 

This project also showcases Power Bi mastery including DAX functions for Month to Date calculations, DAX tables for top 3 values, visuals with drill down and slicing functionality, bookmarks for navigation, a glossary and accompanying documentation.


<h1> Overall, my experience will enable me to drive efficiency, create formal processes, design and develop data architecture, build reliable roadmaps, and optimize reports using various tools and technologies for your organization. </h1> 

I am excited about the prospect of joining your team and I look forward to contributing towards the company's success. Contact me at <b> hire@remote-data-engineering.com or connect with me on <a href = "https://www.linkedin.com/in/remotedataengineer/"> LinkedIn </a> </b>
